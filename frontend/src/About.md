## About: The Website

This site provides an visual representation of [Evolving Hockey's](https://evolving-hockey.com/) Goals Above Replacement Model. 

It aims not to provide a definitive answer to how good a player is, rather to be used as a tool in evaluating some aspects of a player's performance. As always, models have their flaws and thus should be combined with the eye test and other sources in evaluating a player's true contributions.

This website was developed by Max Sun, source code can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/pingu15/Offside).
