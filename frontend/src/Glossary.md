The values displayed are percentile rankings of the player's stats amongst their position (Forwards/Defencemen).

GAR: [Goals Above Replacement](https://evolving-hockey.com/)

The OVR and EXP stats can be expected to differ due to quality of teammates, competition, luck, and shooting talent. For example, a player may drive play very well (high xGAR, or EXP), but either they or their temmates have trouble finishing scoring chances (lack of shooting talent or luck).
